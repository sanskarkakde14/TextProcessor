## Django based text processing app

This is a django backed web-app capable of performing text operations:-

1. Punctuations removal
2. Conversion of text to UPPERCASE
3. Removal of extra lines
4. Removal of extra space.

The html-css-bootstrap frontend form is served via POST requests secured by CSRF tokens (Cross site request forgery) also two pages are added in template folder namely index.html which is the default (#) page of site and analyze.html which just displays the redered request from django to template code. Any changes, suggestions and pull requests are welcomed..☺️.
